Incubator for projects
----------------------

* Baza
Btree based database, like sqlite3. Main things to do is multithreading,
saving to disk and logging(journaling). I think it will be tightly coupled with
my web project. Experiments with LSM tree.

* Web
SCGI web app in... C. Sounds crazy, but I think it is good. I want to do
something like calculator, safe password storage and possibly image processor.

* Exp
Experiments in different languages. Primary in Haskell. I love functional
programming.

* CodeCon
Code contest problems playground.

* Env
Settings for my editor and so on.
