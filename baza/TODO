-- Use stack and refactor splitting.
-- Make compare function in BTree.
-- Binary search in BTree node.

Make linked list on leaves (bottom level nodes). In order to do this
need to implement iterator: find to iterator with get/set/walk operations.

Mem counter: atomic add/sub

Multithreaded btree. Smart lock of nodes. Have no idea how to do this.
Btree disk operations. I/O queue. File chunks allocator.

Command and interpreter. Do I need VM?

HTTP server. This will just report something. Main thing is to listen for
commands.

Add allocator for btree nodes, because it allocs same block size always,
possible optimizations.
