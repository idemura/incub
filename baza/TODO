-- Use stack and refactor splitting.
-- Make compare function in BTree.
-- Binary search in BTree node.

-- Make linked list on leaves (bottom level nodes).
-- Iterator.
Store one key only in leaf.

-- Add perf and time measure functions.
Make perf tests.

-- Create log functions with timestamp. Set file.
-- Flush mode.
Mem counter: atomic add/sub.

Btree disk operations.
I/O queue and I/O thread performing writes.

Multithreaded btree. Smart lock of nodes. Have no idea how to do this.

Command and interpreter. Do I need VM?

HTTP server. This will just report something. Main thing is to listen for
commands.

Add allocator for btree nodes, because it allocs same block size always,
possible optimizations.
