### TODO list.

* Add user to the database. Ask for nickname for new ones?

Done:

* Login with Google OAuth 2.

* Enlive: do not escape & in href attribute. Works and intended. & should be
  escaped.
* JSON parser.

  Ability to add paragraphs in the post with naming of the author?
* Upload photos from Android?
* Code review.
* Diff tool as IntelliJ TeamCity.
* Community blog.
